# Week 1 â€” App 

## Homework 
I followed along with the live bootcamp twice and succesfully launched Docker and have the backend and frontend working.
Successfully connected the backend port 4567 to display code, had errors initialy due to naming of class in app.py
Frontend is working and displaing notification page
