# Week 1 â€” App 

## Homework

I followed along with the live bootcamp twice and succesfully launched Docker and have the backend and frontend working.

Successfully connected the backend port 4567 to display code, had errors initialy due to naming of class in app.py, worked through it by searching through the code and replacing with either correctly spelled Notifications or ShowActivity was misspelled.

Backend had similiar errors but able to find and fix. Frontend and backend is working and displaing notification page as expected.
