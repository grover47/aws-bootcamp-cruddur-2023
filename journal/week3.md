## I did run into several issues with code for cognito and JWT in cognito_jwt_token. After rewatching the video numerous times and rebuilding Cognito User pool I was able to implement and resolve the errors for confirmation in cognito.

## JWT Server side video took 2 solid days of debugging and correcting any issues, for example spelling, or not removing = sign in the code. these were a few of the code issues I ran into. Happy to report I able to resolve and complete requirements for homework.
