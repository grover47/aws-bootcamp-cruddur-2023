# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework and Stretch Assignments
### Install AWS CLI

I initially had this setup, but clearly not proper. I re-installed, configured and followed the proper procedure for saving to the environment.
Committed and pushed to the gitpod.yml file and running the aws sts gett-caller-identtity now produces the correct information.

Created asset folder and uploaded screen shots for all homework.
Updated in student portal, with my overview of what I did for homework assignments.

### Stretch Homework Assignments
Created a support ticket requesting a service limitt increase for cloudwatch logs. Screenshot is uploaded in my assets folder via journal.
I created the Eventbridge rule, SNS topic, and had it send notifications when an EC2 I created changed instance state. In the assets folder I have put 3 screenshots.
