## Required Homework
### Install AWS CLI

I initially had this setup, but clearly not proper. I re-installed, configured and followed the proper procedure for saving to the environment.

Created assett folder and uploaded screen shots for all homework.
Updated in student portal, with my overview of what I did for homework assignments.
